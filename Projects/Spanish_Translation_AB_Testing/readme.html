<h1 id="problem">Problem</h1>
<p>An e-commerce website is testing A/B test such that if Spanish translation is done by each countryâ€™s local person instead of only one Spanish person, then the sales may increase. There is data of 5 days and we have to determine the success or failure of the test.</p>
<h1 id="solution">Solution</h1>
<ul>
<li>Spain only has the test data and no control data, so It should be excluded from the analysis.</li>
<li>The Argentina and Uruguay have very different test and control sizes. They must be excluded from the analysis.</li>
<li>We should check for data sanity: missing data, duplicated ids, date column might have bad format and so on.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="results">Results</h1>
<ul>
<li>We have only 5 days of data. The power test shows that we need about 10,702,928 data for each group (test and control). So we must conduct the A/B test for few more months to obtain more data.</li>
<li>If we only analyze the given data, we see little bit improvement in later days. (Dec2 and Dec4 with Dec3 have little bit fluctuation).</li>
<li>We should wait for about 5 months and perform the analysis. Then, again we can test our analysis after another few months that whether the new changes actually contribute to the revenue gain or not.</li>
<li>We can do the statistical analysis for each Country and see how it performs for each countries, rather than overall data.</li>
</ul>
