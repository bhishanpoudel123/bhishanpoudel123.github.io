  "question": "When implementing a multi-armed bandit algorithm for real-time optimization, which approach balances exploration and exploitation most effectively?",
  "options": [
    "Epsilon-greedy with annealing schedule",
    "`Upper Confidence Bound` (UCB) algorithm",
    "`Thompson Sampling` with prior distribution updates",
    "Contextual bandits with linear payoffs"
  ],
  "answer": "`Thompson Sampling` with prior distribution updates",
  "explanation": "Thompson Sampling with Bayesian updates to prior distributions maintains explicit uncertainty estimates and naturally balances exploration/exploitation, with theoretical guarantees of optimality and empirically better performance than UCB and epsilon-greedy methods in many applications.",
