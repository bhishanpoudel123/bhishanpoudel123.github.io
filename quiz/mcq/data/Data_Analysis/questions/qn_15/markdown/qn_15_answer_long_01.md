### **Question 15**

**Q:** What's the correct approach to implement a custom scoring function for model evaluation in scikit-learn that handles class imbalance better than accuracy?

**Options:**

* A. `sklearn.metrics.make_scorer(custom_metric, greater_is_better=True)`
* B. `sklearn.metrics.make_scorer(custom_metric, needs_proba=True, greater_is_better=True)`
* C. Create a scorer class that implements `__call__(self, estimator, X, y)` and `get_score()` methods
* D. A and B are both correct depending on the `custom_metric` function

**✅ Correct Answer:** A and B are both correct depending on the `custom_metric` function

---

### 🧠 Explanation:

Scikit-learn's `make_scorer()` lets you wrap a custom metric into a scorer object for use in model evaluation (e.g., with `GridSearchCV`). Depending on the nature of your custom metric, the parameters you pass will differ:

---

#### ✅ D. **A and B are both correct depending on the custom\_metric function**

* Use `needs_proba=True` if your metric requires **predicted probabilities** (e.g., AUC).
* Use `needs_threshold=True` if your metric needs **decision scores** (e.g., precision-recall at a threshold).
* For metrics that only require class labels, no special flags are needed.

```python
from sklearn.metrics import make_scorer, f1_score, roc_auc_score

# Custom metric using class labels (e.g., F1)
f1_scorer = make_scorer(f1_score, average='macro', greater_is_better=True)

# Custom metric using probabilities (e.g., AUC)
auc_scorer = make_scorer(roc_auc_score, needs_proba=True, greater_is_better=True)
```

✔️ This flexibility makes both options valid depending on what the custom metric requires.

### ❌ Other Options:

#### A. **make\_scorer(custom\_metric, greater\_is\_better=True)**

This is correct **only if your metric works with class labels**.

```python
# Works fine for balanced_accuracy, F1, precision, etc.
from sklearn.metrics import balanced_accuracy_score

scorer = make_scorer(balanced_accuracy_score, greater_is_better=True)
```

🔵 **Correct in specific use-cases**, but not universally.

---

#### B. **make\_scorer(custom\_metric, needs\_proba=True, greater\_is\_better=True)**

This is correct **only if your metric requires probability estimates**, such as:

* AUC
* Brier score
* Log loss (negative)

```python
# AUC scorer
from sklearn.metrics import roc_auc_score
auc_scorer = make_scorer(roc_auc_score, needs_proba=True)
```

🔵 **Also correct**, but limited to metrics that need probabilities.

---

#### ❌ C. **Create a scorer class with **call** and get\_score()**

This is **not standard practice in scikit-learn**. While technically possible using custom objects, `make_scorer()` is the idiomatic, supported approach for plugging in custom metrics.

🟥 **Unnecessary and unsupported unless you are extending scikit-learn internals.**
