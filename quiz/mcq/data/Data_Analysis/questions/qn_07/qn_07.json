  "options": [
    "Pearson correlation matrix with hierarchical clustering",
    "Distance correlation matrix with MDS visualization",
    "`MINE` statistics (Maximal Information-based Nonparametric Exploration)",
    "Random Forest feature importance with partial dependence plots"
  ],
  "answer": "`MINE` statistics (Maximal Information-based Nonparametric Exploration)",
  "explanation": "MINE statistics, particularly the Maximal Information Coefficient (MIC), detect both linear and non-linear associations without assuming a specific functional form, outperforming traditional correlation measures for complex relationships.",
