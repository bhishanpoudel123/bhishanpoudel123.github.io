# Data Science Study Guide - Question 07

## **Question:**
Which technique is most appropriate for identifying non-linear relationships between variables in a high-dimensional dataset?

## **Answer Choices:**
1. **Pearson correlation matrix with hierarchical clustering**  
2. **Distance correlation matrix with MDS visualization**  
3. **`MINE` statistics (Maximal Information-based Nonparametric Exploration)**  
4. **Random Forest feature importance with partial dependence plots**

## **Correct Answer:** `MINE` statistics (Maximal Information-based Nonparametric Exploration)

### **Explanation:**
MINE (Maximal Information-based Nonparametric Exploration) statistics, particularly the **Maximal Information Coefficient (MIC)**, can detect both **linear and non-linear** associations between variables.  
- Traditional methods, like Pearson correlation, **fail** to capture non-linear relationships.
- MIC does **not assume a functional form**, making it powerful for detecting **complex interactions** in high-dimensional data.
- It's useful for exploratory data analysis where relationships are unknown.

Python implementation using `minepy`:
```python
import numpy as np
from minepy import MINE

# Example data
x = np.random.rand(100)
y = np.sin(x * np.pi) + np.random.normal(0, 0.1, size=100)  # Non-linear relationship

# Compute MIC
mine = MINE()
mine.compute_score(x, y)

print("MIC:", mine.mic())  # Higher MIC indicates stronger association
```

## **Why Other Choices Are Incorrect?**
### **1. Pearson correlation matrix with hierarchical clustering**
- Pearson correlation only measures **linear** relationships.
- Clustering based on correlation can group **similar trends** but doesn't **detect complex dependencies**.

Python demonstration:
```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

df = pd.DataFrame(np.random.rand(100, 5), columns=['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E'])
cor_matrix = df.corr(method='pearson')
print(cor_matrix)
```
Fails to capture **non-linear** dependencies.

### **2. Distance correlation matrix with MDS visualization**
- Distance correlation is an improvement but **lacks interpretability** for complex relationships.
- Multi-dimensional Scaling (MDS) visualizes relationships but **does not quantify them**.

### **3. Random Forest feature importance with partial dependence plots**
- Random Forest feature importance detects **associations** but does **not quantify the nature of relationships**.
- Partial dependence plots show **trends**, not statistical strength.

Python example:
```python
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor
from sklearn.inspection import partial_dependence

X = np.random.rand(100, 5)
y = np.sin(X[:, 0] * np.pi)

rf = RandomForestRegressor()
rf.fit(X, y)

pdp = partial_dependence(rf, X, features=[0])
print(pdp)
```
Useful for **feature impact analysis**, but **not ideal for quantifying complex relationships**.
