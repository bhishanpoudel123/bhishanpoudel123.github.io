  "question": "Which technique is most appropriate for analyzing complex interactions between variables in a predictive modeling context?",
  "options": [
    "Generalized Additive Models with tensor product smooths",
    "`Random Forest` with partial dependence plots and ICE curves",
    "`Neural networks` with feature crossing and attention mechanisms",
    "`Gradient Boosting` with SHAP interaction values"
  ],
  "answer": "`Gradient Boosting` with SHAP interaction values",
  "explanation": "Gradient Boosting effectively captures complex non-linear relationships, while SHAP interaction values specifically quantify how much of the prediction is attributable to interactions between features, providing a rigorous statistical framework for analyzing and visualizing interactions.",
