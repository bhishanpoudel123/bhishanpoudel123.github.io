### **Question 13**

**Q:** Which technique is most appropriate for efficiently clustering a dataset with millions of data points and hundreds of features?

**Options:**

* A. `Mini-batch K-means` with dimensionality reduction
* B. `HDBSCAN` with feature selection
* C. `Birch` (Balanced Iterative Reducing and Clustering using Hierarchies)
* D. `Spectral clustering` with Nyström approximation

**✅ Correct Answer:** `Birch` (Balanced Iterative Reducing and Clustering using Hierarchies)

### 🧠 Explanation:

#### ✅ C. **Birch (Balanced Iterative Reducing and Clustering using Hierarchies)**

**BIRCH** is specifically designed for **very large datasets**. It builds a **Clustering Feature (CF) tree** to summarize the data and then performs clustering on this compact representation. It is:

* ✅ **Memory-efficient** (only loads data incrementally)
* ✅ **Scalable** (linear time complexity)
* ✅ Good at detecting outliers
* ✅ Supports partial fitting for streaming data

```python
from sklearn.cluster import Birch
from sklearn.datasets import make_blobs

# Simulated large dataset
X, _ = make_blobs(n_samples=1_000_000, centers=10, n_features=100, random_state=42)

# Birch clustering
model = Birch(threshold=0.5, n_clusters=10)
model.fit(X)
labels = model.predict(X)
```

✔️ **Best choice** for large-scale clustering with high-dimensional data.

### ❌ Other Options:

#### A. **Mini-batch K-means with dimensionality reduction**

`MiniBatchKMeans` is a scalable version of K-means, and combining it with **dimensionality reduction** (e.g., PCA) makes it faster. However:

* ❌ Still assumes **spherical clusters**
* ❌ Not robust to noise or outliers
* ❌ Requires choosing `k` in advance
* ✅ Good for large data, but **less flexible** than BIRCH

```python
from sklearn.cluster import MiniBatchKMeans
from sklearn.decomposition import PCA

X_reduced = PCA(n_components=50).fit_transform(X)
model = MiniBatchKMeans(n_clusters=10, batch_size=1000)
labels = model.fit_predict(X_reduced)
```

🟡 **Decent choice, but not as robust as BIRCH for hierarchical structure or outliers.**

---

#### B. **HDBSCAN with feature selection**

`HDBSCAN` is powerful for **density-based hierarchical clustering**. However:

* ❌ **Not scalable** to millions of data points
* ✅ Finds clusters of varying densities
* ✅ Doesn’t require specifying `k`
* ❌ Can be **computationally expensive** on large/high-dimensional data

```python
import hdbscan
from sklearn.feature_selection import SelectKBest, f_classif

# Feature selection
X_selected = SelectKBest(k=50).fit_transform(X, _)

# HDBSCAN (computationally expensive on large datasets)
clusterer = hdbscan.HDBSCAN(min_cluster_size=50)
labels = clusterer.fit_predict(X_selected)
```

🔴 **Powerful but unsuitable for huge datasets.**

---

#### D. **Spectral clustering with Nyström approximation**

`Spectral Clustering` is effective on **non-convex clusters**, but:

* ❌ Scales **poorly** with sample size (`O(n³)` time)
* ✅ Nyström approximation speeds it up, but still not scalable to **millions of points**
* ❌ High memory usage
* ❌ Needs computation of affinity matrix

```python
from sklearn.cluster import SpectralClustering

# Approximate version requires kernel approximations (e.g., Nyström)
model = SpectralClustering(n_clusters=10, affinity='nearest_neighbors')
labels = model.fit_predict(X[:10000])  # Subsampling due to scale
```

🔴 **Not suitable for large-scale use without aggressive approximation.**
