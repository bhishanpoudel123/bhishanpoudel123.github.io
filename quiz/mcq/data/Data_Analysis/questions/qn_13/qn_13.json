  "question": "Which technique is most appropriate for efficiently clustering a dataset with millions of data points and hundreds of features?",
  "options": [
    "`Mini-batch K-means` with dimensionality reduction",
    "`HDBSCAN` with feature selection",
    "`Birch` (Balanced Iterative Reducing and Clustering using Hierarchies)",
    "`Spectral clustering` with Nystr\u00c3\u00b6m approximation"
  ],
  "answer": "`Birch` (Balanced Iterative Reducing and Clustering using Hierarchies)",
  "explanation": "Birch is specifically designed for very large datasets as it builds a tree structure in a single pass through the data, has linear time complexity, limited memory requirements, and can handle outliers effectively, making it ideal for clustering massive high-dimensional datasets.",
