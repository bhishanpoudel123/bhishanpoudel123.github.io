  "question": "When implementing stratified k-fold cross-validation for a multi-label classification problem, which approach is most statistically sound?",
  "options": [
    "Use sklearn's `StratifiedKFold` with the most common label for each instance",
    "Create an iterative partitioning algorithm that balances all label combinations across folds",
    "Use sklearn's `MultilabelStratifiedKFold` from the iterative-stratification package",
    "Convert to a multi-class problem using label powerset and then apply standard stratification"
  ],
  "answer": "Use sklearn's `MultilabelStratifiedKFold` from the iterative-stratification package",
  "explanation": "MultilabelStratifiedKFold implements iterative stratification, which preserves the distribution of all labels across folds, addressing the key challenge in multi-label stratification that normal StratifiedKFold cannot handle.",
