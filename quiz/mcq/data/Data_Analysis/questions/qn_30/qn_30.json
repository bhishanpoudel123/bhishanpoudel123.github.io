  "question": "What's the most statistically sound approach to perform feature selection for a regression task with potential non-linear relationships?",
  "options": [
    "`Mutual information`-based selection with permutation testing",
    "`LASSO` regression with stability selection",
    "`Random Forest` with Boruta algorithm",
    "`Generalized Additive Models` with significance testing of smooth terms"
  ],
  "answer": "`Mutual information`-based selection with permutation testing",
  "explanation": "Mutual information captures both linear and non-linear dependencies between variables without assuming functional form, while permutation testing provides a statistically rigorous way to assess the significance of these dependencies, controlling for multiple testing issues.",
