  "question": "What's the most rigorous approach to handle missing data in a longitudinal study with potential non-random missingness?",
  "options": [
    "Multiple imputation by chained equations (MICE) with auxiliary variables",
    "Pattern mixture models with sensitivity analysis",
    "Joint modeling of missingness and outcomes",
    "Inverse probability weighting with doubly robust estimation"
  ],
  "answer": "Joint modeling of missingness and outcomes",
  "explanation": "Joint modeling directly incorporates the missingness mechanism into the analysis model, allowing for valid inference under non-random missingness (MNAR) scenarios by explicitly modeling the relationship between the missing data process and the outcomes of interest.",
