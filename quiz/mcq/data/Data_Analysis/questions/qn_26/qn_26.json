  "question": "What's the most appropriate technique for feature selection when dealing with multicollinearity in a regression context?",
  "options": [
    "Forward stepwise selection with VIF thresholding",
    "`Elastic Net` regularization with cross-validation",
    "Principal Component Regression (PCR)",
    "Recursive Feature Elimination with stability selection"
  ],
  "answer": "`Elastic Net` regularization with cross-validation",
  "explanation": "Elastic Net combines L1 and L2 penalties, handling multicollinearity by grouping correlated features while still performing feature selection, with the optimal balance determined through cross-validation\u00e2\u20ac\u201dmaking it more effective than methods that either eliminate or transform features.",
