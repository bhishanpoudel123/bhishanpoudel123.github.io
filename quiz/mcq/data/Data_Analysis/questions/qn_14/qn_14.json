  "options": [
    "Elbow method with distortion scores",
    "Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) or Akaike Information Criterion (AIC)",
    "Cross-validation with log-likelihood scoring",
    "Variational Bayesian inference with automatic relevance determination"
  ],
  "answer": "Variational Bayesian inference with automatic relevance determination",
  "explanation": "Variational Bayesian inference with automatic relevance determination (implemented in sklearn as GaussianMixture(n_components=n, weight_concentration_prior_type='dirichlet_process')) can automatically prune unnecessary components, effectively determining the optimal number without requiring multiple model fits and comparisons.",
