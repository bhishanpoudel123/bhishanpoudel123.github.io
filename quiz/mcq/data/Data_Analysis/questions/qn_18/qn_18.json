  "question": "What's the most statistically sound approach to handle heteroscedasticity in a regression model?",
  "options": [
    "Visual inspection of residuals vs. fitted values plot",
    "`Breusch-Pagan` test for constant variance",
    "`White's test` for homoscedasticity",
    "Both B and C, with different null hypotheses"
  ],
  "answer": "Both B and C, with different null hypotheses",
  "explanation": "Both tests detect heteroscedasticity but with different assumptions: Breusch-Pagan assumes that heteroscedasticity is a linear function of the independent variables, while White's test is more general and doesn't make this assumption, making them complementary approaches.",
