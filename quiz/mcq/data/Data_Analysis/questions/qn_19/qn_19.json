  "question": "Which approach correctly implements a hierarchical time series forecasting model that respects aggregation constraints?",
  "options": [
    "Bottom-up approach: forecast at lowest level and aggregate upwards",
    "Top-down approach: forecast at highest level and disaggregate proportionally",
    "Middle-out approach: forecast at a middle level and propagate in both directions",
    "Reconciliation approach: forecast at all levels independently then reconcile with constraints"
  ],
  "answer": "Reconciliation approach: forecast at all levels independently then reconcile with constraints",
  "explanation": "The reconciliation approach (optimal combination) generates forecasts at all levels independently, then applies a mathematical reconciliation procedure that minimizes revisions while ensuring hierarchical consistency, typically outperforming both bottom-up and top-down approaches.",
