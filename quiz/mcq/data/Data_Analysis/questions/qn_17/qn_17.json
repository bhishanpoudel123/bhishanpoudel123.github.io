  "answer": "Bayesian optimization with Gaussian processes",
  "explanation": "Bayesian optimization with Gaussian processes builds a probabilistic model of the objective function to intelligently select the most promising hyperparameter configurations based on previous evaluations, making it more efficient than random or grid search for exploring high-dimensional parameter spaces.",
