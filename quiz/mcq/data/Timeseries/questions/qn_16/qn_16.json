  "question": "What is the primary difference between ARMA and ARIMA models?",
  "options": [
    "ARIMA includes differencing for non-stationary data, while ARMA requires stationary data",
    "ARIMA works with continuous data, ARMA only works with discrete data",
    "ARIMA includes exogenous variables, ARMA does not",
    "ARIMA can handle missing values, ARMA cannot"
  ],
  "answer": "ARIMA includes differencing for non-stationary data, while ARMA requires stationary data",
  "explanation": "The primary difference between ARMA (AutoRegressive Moving Average) and ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) models is that ARIMA includes a differencing step (the 'I' component) to handle non-stationary data. ARMA models combine autoregressive (AR) and moving average (MA) components but assume that the time series is already stationary. ARIMA extends this by first differencing the data d times to achieve stationarity before applying the ARMA model. This makes ARIMA more versatile for real-world time series that often contain trends. Essentially, an ARIMA(p,d,q) model is equivalent to applying an ARMA(p,q) model to a time series after differencing it d times.",
