  "question": "What does it mean when we say a time series exhibits 'stationarity'?",
  "options": [
    "Its statistical properties remain constant over time",
    "It has no missing values",
    "It shows strong seasonality",
    "It has been sampled at regular intervals"
  ],
  "answer": "Its statistical properties remain constant over time",
  "explanation": "A stationary time series has statistical properties that remain constant over time. Specifically, it has a constant mean, constant variance, and a constant autocorrelation structure. This means the process generating the time series is in statistical equilibrium. Stationarity is a crucial assumption for many time series models, including ARIMA, because it ensures that patterns learned from historical data will continue to be valid in the future. Non-stationary series might have trends (changing mean) or heteroscedasticity (changing variance), which can lead to unreliable forecasts if not properly addressed through transformations like differencing or variance stabilization.",
