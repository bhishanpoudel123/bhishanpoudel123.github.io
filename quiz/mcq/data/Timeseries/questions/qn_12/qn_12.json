  "answer": "To remove trends and achieve stationarity",
  "explanation": "Differencing in time series analysis involves computing the differences between consecutive observations. The primary purpose is to remove trends and achieve stationarity, which is a key requirement for ARIMA modeling. First-order differencing (d=1) can eliminate linear trends by calculating Yt - Yt-1. If the series still shows non-stationarity after first differencing, second-order differencing (d=2) can be applied to remove quadratic trends. However, over-differencing can introduce unnecessary complexity and artificial patterns, so it's important to use statistical tests like the ADF test to determine the appropriate level of differencing needed.",
