### 5. Qn 05: What is overfitting in machine learning?
<details>
<summary><strong>View Answer & Explanation</strong></summary>

**Answer:** When the model performs well on training data but poorly on test data

**Explanation:** Overfitting occurs when a model learns the training data too well, including noise and outliers, which leads to poor generalization to new data.
