  "question": "In the Monty Hall problem, you're on a game show with three doors. Behind one door is a car; behind the others are goats. You pick a door. The host, who knows what's behind each door, opens one of the other doors to reveal a goat. He then offers you the chance to switch your choice to the remaining unopened door. What is the probability of winning the car if you switch?",
  "options": [
    "1/3",
    "1/2",
    "2/3",
    "It doesn't matter"
  ],
  "answer": "2/3",
  "explanation": "Initially, you have a 1/3 probability of choosing the car and a 2/3 probability of choosing a goat. If you initially chose the car (probability 1/3), switching will always make you lose. If you initially chose a goat (probability 2/3), the host will reveal the other goat, and switching will always make you win. Therefore, the probability of winning by switching is 2/3.",
