  "question": "A genetics researcher is studying a trait that is determined by two alleles. The dominant allele A occurs with probability 0.7 and the recessive allele a with probability 0.3. Assuming Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, what is the probability of a randomly selected individual having the genotype Aa?",
  "options": [
    "0.21",
    "0.30",
    "0.42",
    "0.49"
  ],
  "answer": "0.42",
  "explanation": "Under Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, the probability of genotype Aa is 2pq, where p is the probability of allele A and q is the probability of allele a. So P(Aa) = 2 \u00d7 0.7 \u00d7 0.3 = 0.42 or 42%.",
