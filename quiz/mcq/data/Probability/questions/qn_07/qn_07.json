  "question": "You roll a fair 6-sided die repeatedly until you get a 6. What is the expected number of rolls needed?",
  "options": [
    "3",
    "6",
    "5",
    "3.5"
  ],
  "answer": "6",
  "explanation": "This is a geometric distribution with probability of success p = 1/6. The expected value of a geometric distribution is 1/p. So the expected number of rolls needed is 1/(1/6) = 6.",
