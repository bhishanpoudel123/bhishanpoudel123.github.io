  "question": "A biased coin has an unknown probability p of landing heads. After 10 flips, you observe 7 heads. Using a uniform prior distribution for p, what is the expected value of p according to Bayesian analysis?",
  "options": [
    "0.583",
    "0.7",
    "0.636",
    "0.5"
  ],
  "answer": "0.636",
  "explanation": "With a uniform prior distribution (Beta(1,1)) and 7 heads out of 10 flips, the posterior distribution is Beta(1+7, 1+3) = Beta(8, 4). The expected value of a Beta(\u03b1, \u03b2) distribution is \u03b1/(\u03b1+\u03b2). So the expected value of p is 8/(8+4) = 8/12 = 2/3 \u2248 0.667, which is closest to 0.636.",
