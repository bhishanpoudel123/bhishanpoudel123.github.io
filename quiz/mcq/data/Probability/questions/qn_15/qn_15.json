  "question": "A database has 1,000,000 records, and a data scientist estimates that 50 records are corrupted. If the data scientist randomly samples 100 records for manual inspection, what is the probability of finding at least one corrupted record?",
  "options": [
    "0.0050",
    "0.0500",
    "0.4988",
    "0.9950"
  ],
  "answer": "0.4988",
  "explanation": "The probability of selecting a corrupted record is 50/1,000,000 = 0.00005. The probability of not finding any corrupted records in 100 samples is (1 - 0.00005)^100 \u2248 0.9950. Therefore, the probability of finding at least one corrupted record is 1 - 0.9950 = 0.0050 or 0.5%.",
