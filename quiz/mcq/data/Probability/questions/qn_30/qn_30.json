  "question": "In a random sample from a normal distribution with mean 100 and standard deviation 15, what is the probability that a single observation exceeds 125?",
  "options": [
    "0.0478",
    "0.0548",
    "0.0668",
    "0.0951"
  ],
  "answer": "0.0478",
  "explanation": "Standardizing, z = (125 - 100)/15 = 1.67. The probability P(X > 125) = P(Z > 1.67) \u2248 0.0475 or about 4.75%, which is closest to 0.0478.",
