  "question": "In a group of 5 people, what is the probability that at least 2 people have the same zodiac sign (assuming zodiac signs are uniformly distributed across 12 possible signs)?",
  "options": [
    "0.55",
    "0.67",
    "0.82",
    "0.96"
  ],
  "answer": "0.96",
  "explanation": "The probability that all 5 people have different zodiac signs is (12/12) \u00d7 (11/12) \u00d7 (10/12) \u00d7 (9/12) \u00d7 (8/12) = 0.0397. Therefore, the probability that at least 2 people share a zodiac sign is 1 - 0.0397 = 0.9603 \u2248 0.96 or 96%.",
