  "question": "A standard six-sided die is rolled 3 times. What is the probability that the sum of the three rolls equals 10?",
  "options": [
    "1/9",
    "1/6",
    "1/8",
    "1/12"
  ],
  "answer": "1/8",
  "explanation": "When rolling 3 dice, there are 6^3 = 216 possible outcomes. To get a sum of 10, we can have combinations like (1,3,6), (2,2,6), etc. Counting all such combinations gives us 27 favorable outcomes. Therefore, the probability is 27/216 = 1/8.",
