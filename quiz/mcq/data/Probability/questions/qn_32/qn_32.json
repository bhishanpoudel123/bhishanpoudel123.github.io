  "question": "A data scientist runs 20 independent A/B tests, each with a 5% false positive rate (Type I error). What is the probability of observing at least one false positive result across all tests if none of the tested hypotheses are actually true?",
  "options": [
    "0.05",
    "0.64",
    "0.95",
    "0.36"
  ],
  "answer": "0.64",
  "explanation": "The probability of not observing a false positive in a single test is 1 - 0.05 = 0.95. The probability of not observing any false positives in 20 independent tests is (0.95)^20 \u2248 0.358. Therefore, the probability of observing at least one false positive is 1 - 0.358 = 0.642 or about 64.2%.",
