  "question": "In a standard deck of 52 cards, what is the probability of drawing a royal flush (A, K, Q, J, 10 of the same suit) in a 5-card poker hand?",
  "options": [
    "1/649,740",
    "1/30,940",
    "4/2,598,960",
    "1/2,598,960"
  ],
  "answer": "4/2,598,960",
  "explanation": "There are C(52,5) = 2,598,960 possible 5-card hands from a standard deck. There are exactly 4 possible royal flushes (one for each suit). Therefore, the probability is 4/2,598,960 = 1/649,740 or approximately 0.00000154.",
