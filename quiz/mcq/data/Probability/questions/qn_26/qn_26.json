  "question": "In a Poisson process where events occur at an average rate of 3 per hour, what is the probability that exactly 2 events occur in a 1-hour period?",
  "options": [
    "0.149",
    "0.224",
    "0.324",
    "0.423"
  ],
  "answer": "0.224",
  "explanation": "For a Poisson distribution with parameter \u03bb=3, the probability mass function gives P(X=2) = e^(-\u03bb) \u00d7 \u03bb^2 / 2! = e^(-3) \u00d7 3^2 / 2 = e^(-3) \u00d7 9 / 2 = 0.0498 \u00d7 4.5 \u2248 0.224 or about 22.4%.",
