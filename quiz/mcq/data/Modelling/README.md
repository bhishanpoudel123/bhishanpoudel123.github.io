### 1. Qn 01: When implementing stacking ensemble with scikit-learn, what's the most rigorous approach to prevent target leakage in the meta-learner?
<details>
<summary><strong>View Answer & Explanation</strong></summary>

**Answer:** Manually implement out-of-fold predictions for each base learner

**Explanation:** Manually generating out-of-fold predictions ensures the meta-learner only sees predictions made on data that base models weren't trained on, fully preventing leakage while utilizing all data. This approach is more flexible than StackingClassifier and can incorporate diverse base models while maintaining proper validation boundaries.

### 7. Qn 07: Which approach correctly implements a custom kernel for SVM in scikit-learn?
<details>
<summary><strong>View Answer & Explanation</strong></summary>

**Answer:** Define a function that takes two arrays and returns a kernel matrix

**Explanation:** For custom kernels in scikit-learn SVMs, one must define a function K(X, Y) that calculates the kernel matrix between arrays X and Y, then pass this function as the 'kernel' parameter to SVC. This approach allows full flexibility in kernel design while maintaining compatibility with scikit-learn's implementation.
