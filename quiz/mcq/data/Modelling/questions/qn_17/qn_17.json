  "question": "Which approach correctly implements quantile regression forests for prediction intervals?",
  "options": [
    "Use sklearn's RandomForestRegressor with bootstrap=True and calculate empirical quantiles of tree predictions",
    "Use the forestci package to compute jackknife-based prediction intervals",
    "Use GradientBoostingRegressor with loss='quantile' and train separate models for each quantile",
    "Implement a custom version of RandomForestRegressor that stores all leaf node samples"
  ],
  "answer": "Implement a custom version of RandomForestRegressor that stores all leaf node samples",
  "explanation": "Quantile regression forests require storing the empirical distribution of training samples in each leaf node (not just their mean), requiring a custom implementation that extends standard random forests to compute conditional quantiles from these stored distributions.",
