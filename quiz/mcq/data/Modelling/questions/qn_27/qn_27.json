  "question": "Which technique is most appropriate for detecting and visualizing non-linear relationships in supervised learning?",
  "options": [
    "Partial dependence plots with contour plots for interactions",
    "Accumulated Local Effects (ALE) plots with bootstrap confidence intervals",
    "SHAP interaction values with dependency plots",
    "Individual Conditional Expectation (ICE) plots with centered PDP"
  ],
  "answer": "Individual Conditional Expectation (ICE) plots with centered PDP",
  "explanation": "ICE plots show how predictions change for individual instances across the range of a feature, while centering them helps visualize heterogeneous effects that would be masked by averaging in standard partial dependence plots, making them ideal for detecting complex non-linear relationships.",
