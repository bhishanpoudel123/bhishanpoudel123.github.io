  "question": "Which approach correctly implements proper evaluation metrics for a multi-class imbalanced classification problem?",
  "options": [
    "Use macro-averaged precision, recall, and F1 score",
    "Implement balanced accuracy and Cohen's kappa statistic",
    "Use ROC AUC with one-vs-rest approach and weighted averaging",
    "Apply precision-recall curves with prevalence-corrected metrics"
  ],
  "answer": "Apply precision-recall curves with prevalence-corrected metrics",
  "explanation": "For imbalanced multi-class problems, precision-recall curves with prevalence correction (e.g., weighted by actual class frequencies) provide more informative evaluation than accuracy or ROC-based metrics, focusing on relevant performance for minority classes while accounting for class distribution.",
