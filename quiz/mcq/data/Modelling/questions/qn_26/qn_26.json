  "question": "What's the most efficient way to implement hyperparameter tuning for an ensemble of diverse model types?",
  "options": [
    "Use separate GridSearchCV for each model type and combine best models",
    "Implement nested hyperparameter optimization with DEAP genetic algorithm",
    "Use FLAML for automated and efficient hyperparameter tuning",
    "Apply multi-objective Bayesian optimization to balance diversity and performance"
  ],
  "answer": "Apply multi-objective Bayesian optimization to balance diversity and performance",
  "explanation": "Multi-objective Bayesian optimization can simultaneously optimize for both individual model performance and ensemble diversity, finding an optimal set of hyperparameters for each model type while ensuring the ensemble as a whole performs well through complementary strengths.",
