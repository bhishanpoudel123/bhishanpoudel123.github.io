  "question": "What's the most effective way to implement a time-based split for cross-validation in time series forecasting?",
  "options": [
    "Use sklearn's TimeSeriesSplit with appropriate gap",
    "Implement a sliding window validation with fixed lookback period",
    "Use BlockingTimeSeriesSplit from sktime with custom test window growth",
    "Define a custom cross-validator with expanding window and purging"
  ],
  "answer": "Define a custom cross-validator with expanding window and purging",
  "explanation": "A custom cross-validator with expanding windows (increasing training set) and purging (gap between train and test to prevent leakage) most accurately simulates real-world forecasting scenarios while handling temporal dependencies and avoiding lookahead bias.",
