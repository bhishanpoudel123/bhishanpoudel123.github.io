  ],
  "answer": "Nested loops of KFold.split(), with inner loop for hyperparameter tuning",
  "explanation": "Proper nested cross-validation requires an outer loop for performance estimation and an inner loop for hyperparameter tuning, completely separating the data used for model selection from the data used for model evaluation, avoiding optimistic bias.",
