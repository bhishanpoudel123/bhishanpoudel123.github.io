  "question": "What's the most rigorous approach to quantify uncertainty in predictions from a gradient boosting model?",
  "options": [
    "Use quantile regression with multiple target quantiles",
    "Implement Monte Carlo dropout in gradient boosting",
    "Apply jackknife resampling to estimate prediction variance",
    "Use Lower Upper Bound Estimation (LUBE) with pinball loss"
  ],
  "answer": "Use quantile regression with multiple target quantiles",
  "explanation": "Training multiple gradient boosting models with quantile loss functions at different quantiles (e.g., 5%, 50%, 95%) directly models the conditional distribution of the target variable, providing a rigorous non-parametric approach to uncertainty quantification that captures heteroscedasticity.",
