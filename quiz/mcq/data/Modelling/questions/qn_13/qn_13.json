  "question": "Which technique is most appropriate for detecting and quantifying the importance of interaction effects in a Random Forest model?",
  "options": [
    "Use feature_importances_ attribute and partial dependence plots",
    "Implement H-statistic from Friedman and Popescu",
    "Extract and analyze individual decision paths from trees",
    "Use permutation importance with pairwise feature shuffling"
  ],
  "answer": "Implement H-statistic from Friedman and Popescu",
  "explanation": "The H-statistic specifically quantifies interaction strength between features by comparing the variation in predictions when features are varied together versus independently, providing a statistical measure of interactions that can't be captured by standard importance metrics or partial dependence alone.",
