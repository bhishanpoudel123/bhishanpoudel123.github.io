  "question": "Which is the most statistically rigorous approach to implement feature selection for a regression problem with heteroscedastic errors?",
  "options": [
    "Use sklearn's SelectFromModel with LassoCV",
    "Implement weighted LASSO with weight inversely proportional to error variance",
    "Apply robust feature selection using Huber regression",
    "Implement stability selection with bootstrapped samples"
  ],
  "answer": "Implement weighted LASSO with weight inversely proportional to error variance",
  "explanation": "Weighted LASSO that downweights observations with high error variance accounts for heteroscedasticity in the selection process, ensuring that features aren't selected or rejected due to non-constant error variance, resulting in more reliable feature selection.",
