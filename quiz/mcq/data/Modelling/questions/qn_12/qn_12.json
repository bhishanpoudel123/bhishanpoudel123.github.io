  "question": "What's the most robust approach to handling class imbalance in a multi-class classification problem?",
  "options": [
    "Use class_weight='balanced' in sklearn classifiers",
    "Apply SMOTE for oversampling minority classes",
    "Implement a cost-sensitive learning approach with custom loss function",
    "Use ensemble methods with resampling strategies specific to each classifier"
  ],
  "answer": "Use ensemble methods with resampling strategies specific to each classifier",
  "explanation": "Ensemble methods with class-specific resampling strategies (e.g., EasyEnsemble or SMOTEBoost) combine the diversity of multiple classifiers with targeted handling of class imbalance, outperforming both global resampling and simple class weighting, especially for multi-class problems with varying degrees of imbalance.",
