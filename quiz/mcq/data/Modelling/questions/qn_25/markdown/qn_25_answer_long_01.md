### ✅ Question 25

**Q: Which approach correctly addresses Simpson's paradox in a predictive modeling context?**

**Correct Answer:**  
`Use causal graphical models to identify proper conditioning sets`

---

### 🧠 Key Concepts

- **Simpson’s Paradox:** A trend appears in different groups of data but reverses or disappears when the groups are combined.
- **Confounding Variable:** A hidden factor that affects both the independent and dependent variables, leading to misleading conclusions.
- **Causal Graphical Models (DAGs):** Directed Acyclic Graphs help identify which variables to condition on to uncover true causal relationships.

---

### 🔍 Why Causal Graphs?

Statistical correlation alone can’t resolve causal ambiguity. DAGs visually represent causal assumptions and guide appropriate adjustment strategies (like backdoor or front-door adjustment) to:
- Avoid over-adjusting.
- Identify confounders.
- Prevent conditioning on colliders.

### 🧪 Example: Resolving Simpson’s Paradox with a DAG

We’ll use `causalgraphicalmodels` to model the causal structure and determine correct adjustments.

```python
# Install: pip install causalgraphicalmodels

from causalgraphicalmodels import CausalGraphicalModel
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Define causal graph
causal_graph = CausalGraphicalModel(
    nodes=["Treatment", "Outcome", "Age"],
    edges=[
        ("Age", "Treatment"),
        ("Age", "Outcome"),
        ("Treatment", "Outcome"),
    ]
)

# Draw the DAG
causal_graph.draw()
plt.title("Causal DAG illustrating Simpson's Paradox")
plt.show()

# Identify adjustment set to estimate causal effect of Treatment on Outcome
print("Adjustment set:", causal_graph.get_backdoor_adjustment_set(
    "Treatment", "Outcome"))
````

**Explanation of DAG:**

* `Age` is a confounder — it influences both `Treatment` and `Outcome`.
* Simpson's paradox may arise if `Age` is not adjusted for.
* The graph shows we must condition on `Age` to correctly estimate the causal effect of `Treatment` on `Outcome`.

---

### 📌 When to Use This

* In healthcare (e.g., treatment effect studies)
* Social science experiments
* Any model where correlation does not imply causation

---

### 🛑 Common Pitfalls

* **Conditioning on colliders** can introduce bias.
* **Adjusting for mediators** can block causal pathways.
* **Failing to adjust for confounders** may produce spurious relationships.
