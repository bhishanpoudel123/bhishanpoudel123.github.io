  "question": "What's the most rigorous approach to handle feature selection with highly correlated features in a regression context?",
  "options": [
    "Sequential feature selection with tolerance for multicollinearity",
    "Recursive feature elimination with cross-validation (RFECV)",
    "Elastic Net regularization with randomized hyperparameter search",
    "Use variance inflation factor (VIF) with backward elimination"
  ],
  "answer": "Elastic Net regularization with randomized hyperparameter search",
  "explanation": "Elastic Net combines L1 and L2 penalties, effectively handling correlated features by either selecting one from a correlated group (via L1) or assigning similar coefficients to correlated features (via L2), with the optimal balance determined through randomized hyperparameter search across different alpha and l1_ratio values.",
