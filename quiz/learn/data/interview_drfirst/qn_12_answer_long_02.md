**Interviewer**: Do you know how BERT was trained? Tell me more about the BERT model's training process specifically.

**Me**: Yes, I'd be happy to explain BERT's training process.

BERT was trained in a two-stage approach:

**Stage 1: Pre-training**
- Trained on unlabeled text from BooksCorpus (800M words) and English Wikipedia (2,500M words)
- Used two unsupervised tasks simultaneously:
  1. Masked Language Modeling: Randomly masked 15% of tokens, where the model had to predict the original words
  2. Next Sentence Prediction: Given two sentences, predict if sentence B actually follows sentence A
- Training hyperparameters included:
  - Batch size of 256 sequences with 512 tokens each
  - Adam optimizer with learning rate of 1e-4
  - Training for 1,000,000 steps, approximately 40 epochs
  - Used WordPiece tokenization with 30,000 token vocabulary

**Stage 2: Fine-tuning**
- Pre-trained model weights were then fine-tuned on labeled data for specific downstream tasks
- During fine-tuning, all parameters were updated end-to-end
- Only minimal architecture changes were needed between pre-training and fine-tuning phases
- Typically required much fewer epochs (2-4) compared to pre-training

This approach of massive unsupervised pre-training followed by supervised fine-tuning is what made BERT so effective across diverse NLP tasks with relatively minimal task-specific data.

In my work with clinical text analytics at Cencora, I leveraged this transfer learning capability to adapt BERT's language understanding to healthcare-specific terminology and contexts.
