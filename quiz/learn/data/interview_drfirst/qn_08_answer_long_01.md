# Q: AWS familiarity


**Q: You seem to have worked mostly with Azure and Databricks. Are you comfortable working with AWS?**

**Answer:**

Yes, I’m definitely comfortable working with AWS.

While I’ve had more hands-on exposure to Azure and Databricks in recent roles, I’ve also worked with AWS services like **S3, SageMaker, Glue, Lambda, Athena**, and **Redshift**—primarily in past projects and through certifications such as *Getting Started with AWS Machine Learning*. In fact, I deployed a fraud detection model pipeline that read raw transaction data from S3, processed it using AWS Glue with PySpark, and served predictions via a SageMaker endpoint.

I’m well-versed with the concepts of IAM roles, bucket policies, model deployment in SageMaker, and building serverless pipelines using Lambda + API Gateway. Also, my strong foundation in cloud principles and MLOps tools like Docker, CI/CD, and MLflow makes transitioning across platforms very smooth.

So while Azure was my main stack in recent roles, I'm equally confident and productive working in AWS environments and can ramp up quickly on any specific tools your team uses.
