### Assumptions of Linear Regression

1. **Linearity**: The relationship between the independent and dependent variables is linear.  
   - Use scatterplots to verify linear trends.

2. **Independence**: Observations are independent of each other.  
   - Residuals should not be autocorrelated. Durbin-Watson test can be used.

3. **Homoscedasticity**: Constant variance of residuals across all levels of the independent variables.  
   - Plot residuals vs. fitted values to check this.

4. **Normality of Errors**: The residuals of the model are normally distributed.  
   - QQ-plots or tests like Shapiro-Wilk can be used.
