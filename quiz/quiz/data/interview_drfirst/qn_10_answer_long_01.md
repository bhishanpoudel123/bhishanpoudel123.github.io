# Fine tuning bert

You said about fine tuing BERT for text classification.
what to mean exactly? what is the output? what is the process?

**Q: You mentioned fine-tuning BERT for text classification. What does that mean exactly? What is the output, and what is the process?**

**Answer:**

Great question. Fine-tuning BERT for text classification means taking a pre-trained BERT model and training it further on a labeled dataset specific to your classification task—in this case, medical text classification—so it learns to make accurate predictions on your domain-specific data.


### 🔍 **What It Means**

BERT is a general-purpose language model pre-trained on a large corpus like Wikipedia. It understands language well, but doesn’t “know” about your specific labels like “Medication Inquiry” or “Appointment Scheduling”.
Fine-tuning teaches it how to **map a text input to one of the classes** by adding a classification head (usually a linear layer) on top and training the model end-to-end.



### 🛠 **The Process**

1. **Data Preparation**:

   * Collect and label a dataset, e.g.:

     ```
     "I need a refill on my prescription" → Medication Request
     "Can I see Dr. Smith tomorrow?" → Appointment Scheduling
     ```
   * Tokenize the text using the BERT tokenizer (e.g., WordPiece), pad/truncate to a fixed sequence length.

2. **Model Setup**:

   * Load a pre-trained model like `bert-base-uncased`.
   * Add a `Linear` layer (classification head) on top of the `[CLS]` token output, which summarizes the sentence.
   * Define a `CrossEntropyLoss` function for multi-class classification.

3. **Training Loop**:

   * Fine-tune the entire model using your labeled data (typically for 2–5 epochs).
   * Use optimizers like `AdamW` with learning rate warm-up and weight decay.

4. **Validation and Testing**:

   * Monitor metrics like accuracy, F1-score, precision, and recall on a held-out validation set.
   * Use stratified sampling and confusion matrices to ensure robustness across all classes.



### 📤 **The Output**

* A **fine-tuned BERT model** that takes clinical text as input and returns the predicted class (e.g., "Medication Inquiry").
* Additionally, the model can return **confidence scores** or probabilities per class, which can be used for downstream decision-making or threshold tuning.

For example:

```json
Input: "I feel dizzy after taking the new pills"
Output: {"Medication Side Effects": 0.91, "Appointment Request": 0.06, "General Inquiry": 0.03}
```



### 🧠 **Why It Works Well in Healthcare**

Because BERT understands context deeply, it can distinguish between phrases like:

* “Dizzy after meds” → side effect
* “Missed meds” → adherence issue
  This is crucial in medical domains where subtle phrasing matters a lot.



**Summary**:
Fine-tuning BERT tailors a powerful general model to your specific classification problem by updating its weights based on your labeled examples. The result is a high-accuracy, domain-specific classifier ready for real-time or batch inference.



Would you like the Python code snippet or notebook setup for this fine-tuning pipeline?

Certainly! Here's a complete **Python code snippet** using Hugging Face’s `transformers` library to fine-tune **BERT** for a medical **text classification** task:



### 📦 1. **Install Required Packages**

```bash
pip install transformers datasets scikit-learn torch
```



### 🧪 2. **Sample Dataset (Medical Texts)**

```python
texts = [
    "I need a refill on my prescription.",
    "Can I see Dr. Smith tomorrow?",
    "I feel dizzy after taking the new pills.",
    "What's the clinic address?",
]
labels = ["Medication Request", "Appointment Scheduling", "Medication Side Effects", "General Inquiry"]

# Map labels to numeric values
label2id = {label: i for i, label in enumerate(set(labels))}
id2label = {v: k for k, v in label2id.items()}
encoded_labels = [label2id[label] for label in labels]
```



### 🔤 3. **Tokenization**

```python
from transformers import BertTokenizer

tokenizer = BertTokenizer.from_pretrained("bert-base-uncased")
inputs = tokenizer(texts, padding=True, truncation=True, return_tensors="pt")
```



### 🧠 4. **Model Setup**

```python
from transformers import BertForSequenceClassification

num_classes = len(label2id)
model = BertForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained("bert-base-uncased", num_labels=num_classes)
```



### 🏋️‍♂️ 5. **Training**

```python
import torch
from torch.utils.data import TensorDataset, DataLoader
from transformers import AdamW

labels_tensor = torch.tensor(encoded_labels)
dataset = TensorDataset(inputs["input_ids"], inputs["attention_mask"], labels_tensor)
dataloader = DataLoader(dataset, batch_size=2, shuffle=True)

optimizer = AdamW(model.parameters(), lr=2e-5)

model.train()
for epoch in range(3):
    for batch in dataloader:
        b_input_ids, b_input_mask, b_labels = batch
        outputs = model(input_ids=b_input_ids, attention_mask=b_input_mask, labels=b_labels)
        loss = outputs.loss
        loss.backward()
        optimizer.step()
        optimizer.zero_grad()
        print(f"Epoch {epoch}, Loss: {loss.item():.4f}")
```



### 📈 6. **Inference**

```python
model.eval()
test_text = "I feel dizzy since I started the medication."
tokens = tokenizer(test_text, return_tensors="pt", padding=True, truncation=True)
with torch.no_grad():
    output = model(**tokens)
    logits = output.logits
    predicted_class_id = torch.argmax(logits, dim=1).item()

print("Predicted Class:", id2label[predicted_class_id])
```



### 🗂 7. **Optional: Save and Load**

```python
model.save_pretrained("bert_medical_classifier")
tokenizer.save_pretrained("bert_medical_classifier")

# To load later:
model = BertForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained("bert_medical_classifier")
tokenizer = BertTokenizer.from_pretrained("bert_medical_classifier")
```
