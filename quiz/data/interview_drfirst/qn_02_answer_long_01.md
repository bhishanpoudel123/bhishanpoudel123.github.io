# Q: How to use FastAPI without making unresonable errors in production when creating chatbots

To use **FastAPI** effectively in production for chatbots â€” without making unreasonable or costly errors â€” you need to combine **solid engineering practices**, **robust deployment configurations**, and **awareness of common pitfalls**.

Hereâ€™s a concise breakdown from an expert data scientist's and MLOps practitioner's perspective:



### âœ… **Best Practices for Using FastAPI in Production (Chatbots)**

#### 1. **Validation & Error Handling**

* **Use Pydantic models** to strictly define request/response schemas.
* Catch malformed input early with FastAPI's automatic validation.
* Implement **custom exception handlers** for predictable error responses (`HTTPException`, 422, 500, etc.).

#### 2. **Async I/O Everywhere**

* Use `async def` endpoints to leverage FastAPI's full performance benefits (non-blocking I/O).
* Ensure dependencies like database clients or HTTP calls are also async-compatible (e.g., `httpx`, `asyncpg`).

#### 3. **Rate Limiting & Abuse Prevention**

* Protect chatbot APIs from misuse or DDoS with:

  * API gateways (e.g., **Azure API Management**, **NGINX** with rate-limiting),
  * Or use packages like `slowapi` for in-app rate limiting.

#### 4. **Avoid Blocking LLM Calls**

* Offload heavy LLM (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.) inference calls to **background workers** using `Celery` or `FastAPI BackgroundTasks`, especially if responses are slow.
* Optionally stream responses using Server-Sent Events (SSE) or WebSockets.

#### 5. **Caching for Latency Reduction**

* Use `Redis` or `local memory cache` to store responses for frequently asked questions (as you did at Cencora).
* Combine this with vector similarity matching for semantic caching.

#### 6. **Logging & Monitoring**

* Add structured logging (`loguru`, `uvicorn.log_config`) for tracking API behavior and failures.
* Integrate monitoring tools like **Prometheus + Grafana**, **New Relic**, or **Azure Application Insights**.

#### 7. **Security Hygiene**

* Use **OAuth2** / **API keys** for authentication.
* Sanitize user input to prevent prompt injection and data leakage.
* Use HTTPS and enforce CORS policies as needed.

#### 8. **Deployment**

* Use **Gunicorn** with **Uvicorn workers** for production (e.g., `gunicorn -k uvicorn.workers.UvicornWorker`).
* Set timeouts properly (e.g., `--timeout 500` for long LLM calls).
* Use a reverse proxy (like NGINX or Azure Front Door) in front of the API.

#### 9. **CI/CD and Testing**

* Implement unit tests with `pytest`, especially for core logic and FastAPI routes.
* Add a pre-deployment pipeline that runs tests and lints code (GitHub Actions, Azure DevOps, etc.).

#### 10. **Scalability Considerations**

* Deploy on scalable infrastructure (e.g., **Azure App Service**, **AWS ECS**, or **Kubernetes**).
* Use horizontal scaling + load balancers if handling many concurrent users.



### ðŸ’¡ TL;DR for FastAPI Chatbots in Production:

> **Validate strictly. Cache smartly. Secure aggressively. Scale thoughtfully.**
