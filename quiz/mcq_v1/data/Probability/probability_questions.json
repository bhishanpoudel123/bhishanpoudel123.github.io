      "Greater than 90%",

    ],
    "answer": "Greater than 90%",
    "explanation": "This is the famous birthday paradox. The probability is computed as 1 minus the probability that all birthdays are different. For 30 people, P(at least one shared birthday) = 1 - (365/365 × 364/365 × 363/365 × ... × 336/365) ≈ 0.706, which is approximately 70.6%. While this is closest to 'About 70%', the exact calculation gives 70.6%, not 'Greater than 90%'. The probability exceeds 90% when there are 41 or more people in the room."

    "explanation": "We use the binomial probability formula: P(X=k) = C(n,k) × p^k × (1-p)^(n-k), where n=5, k=3, p=0.6. C(5,3) = 10 possible ways to arrange 3 heads in 5 flips. So P(X=3) = 10 × (0.6)^3 × (0.4)^2 = 10 × 0.216 × 0.16 = 0.3456 or 34.56%."

    "answer": "0.27",
    "explanation": "Using Bayes' theorem: PPV = P(Disease|Positive test) = [P(Positive test|Disease) × P(Disease)] / P(Positive test). P(Positive test) = P(Positive test|Disease) × P(Disease) + P(Positive test|No Disease) × P(No Disease) = 0.9 × 0.02 + 0.05 × 0.98 = 0.018 + 0.049 = 0.067. Therefore, PPV = (0.9 × 0.02) / 0.067 = 0.018/0.067 ≈ 0.27 or 27%."

    "question": "In a lottery where 5 numbers are drawn from 1 to 49 without replacement, what is the probability of matching exactly 3 numbers on a single ticket?",
    "options": [
      "0.012",
      "0.015",
      "0.018",
      "0.021"
    ],
    "answer": "0.015",
    "explanation": "Total number of possible 5-number combinations is C(49,5) = 1,906,884. Ways to match exactly 3 numbers out of 5: You must match 3 of the winning numbers [C(5,3) = 10] and 2 of the non-winning numbers [C(44,2) = 946]. So favorable outcomes = 10 × 946 = 9,460. Probability = 9,460/1,906,884 ≈ 0.00496 or about 0.5%."

    "answer": "0.0478",
    "explanation": "Standardizing, z = (125 - 100)/15 = 1.67. The probability P(X > 125) = P(Z > 1.67) ≈ 0.0475 or about 4.75%, which is closest to 0.0478."

    "answer": "0.246",
    "explanation": "This follows a binomial distribution with n=10 and p=0.5. P(X=5) = C(10,5) × (0.5)^5 × (0.5)^5 = 252 × (0.5)^10 = 252/1024 = 0.2461 or about 24.6%."

    "explanation": "The probability of not observing a false positive in a single test is 1 - 0.05 = 0.95. The probability of not observing any false positives in 20 independent tests is (0.95)^20 ≈ 0.358. Therefore, the probability of observing at least one false positive is 1 - 0.358 = 0.642 or about 64.2%."

Of these, 11 outcomes include at least one 6: (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6). Therefore, the probability is 11/15 = 11/15 or about 73.3%."
