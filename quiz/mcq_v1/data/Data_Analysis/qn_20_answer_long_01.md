### **Question 20**

**Q:** What technique is most appropriate for analyzing complex network data with community structures?

**Options:**

* A. K-means clustering on the adjacency matrix
* B. Spectral clustering with normalized Laplacian
* C. `Louvain` algorithm for community detection
* D. DBSCAN on node2vec embeddings

**✅ Correct Answer:** `Louvain` algorithm for community detection

---

### 🧠 Explanation:

#### ✅ C. **Louvain algorithm for community detection**

The **Louvain algorithm** is a greedy optimization method that:

* Maximizes **modularity**, a measure of the strength of division of a network into modules (communities)
* Works **efficiently** on large networks
* Detects **hierarchical community structures**

It’s designed specifically for **network graphs**, unlike many general-purpose clustering algorithms.

```python
import networkx as nx
import community as community_louvain
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Create or load a graph
G = nx.karate_club_graph()

# Apply Louvain
partition = community_louvain.best_partition(G)

# Visualize
pos = nx.spring_layout(G)
nx.draw(G, pos, node_color=list(partition.values()), with_labels=True, cmap=plt.cm.Set1)
plt.show()
```

✔️ Best suited for **complex, large-scale networks** with community structure.

### ❌ Other Options:

#### A. **K-means clustering on the adjacency matrix**

This approach:

* Treats rows of the adjacency matrix as feature vectors
* Applies **Euclidean distance-based** clustering

Limitations:

* ❌ Ignores graph topology (edges aren't used meaningfully)
* ❌ Can't capture **non-Euclidean structure**
* ❌ Poor community detection performance

```python
from sklearn.cluster import KMeans

adj_matrix = nx.to_numpy_array(G)
kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=4).fit(adj_matrix)
```

🔴 **Misuses matrix format**; not graph-aware.

---

#### B. **Spectral clustering with normalized Laplacian**

Spectral clustering:

* Uses eigenvectors of the **Laplacian matrix** derived from the graph
* Can detect **non-convex communities**
* More principled than K-means

But:

* ❌ **Does not scale well** to large graphs
* ❌ Requires knowing number of clusters in advance
* ✅ Useful in smaller or theoretical settings

```python
from sklearn.cluster import SpectralClustering

adj = nx.to_numpy_array(G)
sc = SpectralClustering(n_clusters=4, affinity='precomputed')
labels = sc.fit_predict(adj)
```

🟡 Good for **small graphs**, but **less practical** than Louvain for real-world networks.

---

#### D. **DBSCAN on node2vec embeddings**

DBSCAN is a density-based method, and node2vec creates **vector embeddings** of nodes.

* ✅ Works on **embedded representations**
* ❌ Sensitive to parameters (e.g., `eps`)
* ❌ Doesn’t leverage modularity or graph hierarchy

```python
from sklearn.cluster import DBSCAN
from node2vec import Node2Vec

node2vec = Node2Vec(G, dimensions=64, walk_length=30, num_walks=200)
model = node2vec.fit(window=10, min_count=1)

embeddings = [model.wv[str(n)] for n in G.nodes()]
dbscan = DBSCAN(eps=0.5, min_samples=2).fit(embeddings)
```

🟡 Promising, but less robust than **modularity-based** approaches.
