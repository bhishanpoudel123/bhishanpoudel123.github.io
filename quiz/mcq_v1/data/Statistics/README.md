## Questions
### <a id="q01"></a> Qn 01

**Question**  
What does the p-value represent in hypothesis testing?

**Options**  

1. Probability of null hypothesis being true  
2. Probability of obtaining test results at least as extreme as the results actually observed  
3. Probability of alternative hypothesis  
4. Confidence level  

**Answer**  
Probability of obtaining test results at least as extreme as the results actually observed

**Explanation**  
The p-value quantifies the evidence against the null hypothesis. A small p-value
  suggests the observed data is unlikely under the null hypothesis.

### <a id="q02"></a> Qn 02

**Question**  
What is the main difference between population and sample in statistics?

**Options**  

1. Sample is larger than population  
2. Population is derived from sample  
3. Sample is a subset of population  
4. They are the same  

**Answer**  
Sample is a subset of population

**Explanation**  
A population includes all elements from a set of data, while a sample consists
  of one or more observations drawn from the population.

### <a id="q03"></a> Qn 03

**Question**  
What does standard deviation measure?

**Options**  

1. Average  
2. Spread of data  
3. Skewness  
4. Maximum value  

**Answer**  
Spread of data

**Explanation**  
Standard deviation measures the amount of variation or dispersion of a set of
  values.

### <a id="q04"></a> Qn 04

**Question**  
In a normal distribution, what percentage of data lies within one standard deviation of the mean?

**Options**  

1. 50%  
2. 68%  
3. 95%  
4. 99.7%  

**Answer**  
68%

**Explanation**  
In a normal distribution, approximately 68% of the data falls within one
  standard deviation of the mean.

### <a id="q05"></a> Qn 05

**Question**  
Which of the following measures of central tendency is not affected by extreme values?

**Options**  

1. Mean  
2. Median  
3. Mode  
4. Standard Deviation  

**Answer**  
Median

**Explanation**  
Median is the middle value and is not affected by extremely large or small
  values, unlike the mean.
