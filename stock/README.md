# üìä Stock Calculator Suite

A comprehensive web-based tool for stock investment calculations, featuring multiple calculators to help you make informed decisions about averaging down and recovery strategies.

## üöÄ Features

### 1. üìà Stock Buy Calculator For Loss Status

**Purpose**: Calculate how many additional shares you need to buy to achieve a target average price when you're in a loss position.

**When to Use**: 
- Your current stock buying average is **ABOVE** the current market price (you're at a loss)
- You want to buy more shares at the lower current price to reduce your average cost
- You're implementing an "averaging down" strategy

**Key Metrics Calculated**:
- **Shares to Buy**: Number of additional shares needed at current price to reach target average
- **Total Cost for New Purchase**: Investment amount required for the new purchase
- **Current Average Price**: Your existing average cost per share before buying more
- **Price Increase Needed for Break-Even**: Percentage the stock must rise from current price to reach your current average

**Default Example Values**:
- Robinhood: 3,500 shares at $5.72
- Webull: 3,100 shares at $6.60
- Current Stock Price: $4.00
- Target Average Price: $6.00

**How It Works**:
```
Formula: (Total Cost + New Shares √ó Current Price) / (Total Shares + New Shares) = Target Average
```

The calculator solves for "New Shares" to determine how many you need to buy.

**Example Scenario**:
- You bought 6,600 shares with an average cost of $6.14
- Stock dropped to $4.00
- You want to lower your average to $6.00
- Calculator shows you need to buy X shares at $4.00 to achieve this

### 2. üìâ Stock Recovery Calculator

**Purpose**: Calculate what stock price you need to reach to recover from a realized loss using your current holdings.

**When to Use**:
- You've already sold stocks at a loss (realized loss)
- You currently own shares in the same or different stock
- You want to know what price your current holdings need to reach to offset previous losses

**Key Metrics Calculated**:
- **Current Portfolio Value**: What your current shares are worth now
- **Target Portfolio Value**: Total value needed to recover the realized loss
- **Required Stock Price for Recovery**: Price per share needed to break even
- **Price Increase Needed**: Dollar amount and percentage increase required

**Default Example Values**:
- Realized Loss: $41,000
- Current Stock Price: $7.55
- Number of Shares Owned: 3,500

**How It Works**:
```
Target Value = Current Portfolio Value + Realized Loss
Recovery Price = Target Value / Number of Shares
```

**Example Scenario**:
- You previously lost $41,000 on stock sales
- You now own 3,500 shares at $7.55 each
- Current portfolio value: $26,425
- Calculator shows the stock needs to reach $19.26 to fully recover your loss

## üéì Investment Strategy Notes

### Averaging Down Strategy
**Pros:**
- Lowers your average cost per share
- Potentially faster break-even when stock recovers
- Accumulate more shares at discount prices

**Cons:**
- Increases total capital at risk
- Stock may continue declining
- Opportunity cost of capital
- "Catching a falling knife" risk

**Best Practices:**
- Only average down on fundamentally strong companies
- Have a predetermined limit (don't keep averaging down indefinitely)
- Ensure adequate diversification
- Don't invest money you can't afford to lose
