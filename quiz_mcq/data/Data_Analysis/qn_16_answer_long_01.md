### **Question 16**

**Q:** Which approach correctly implements a memory-efficient data pipeline for processing and analyzing a dataset too large to fit in memory?

**Options:**

* A. Use pandas with `low_memory=True` and `chunksize` parameter
* B. Implement `dask.dataframe` with lazy evaluation and out-of-core computation
* C. Use pandas-on-spark (formerly Koalas) with distributed processing
* D. Implement `vaex` for memory-mapping and out-of-core dataframes

**✅ Correct Answer:** Implement `dask.dataframe` with lazy evaluation and out-of-core computation

### 🧠 Explanation:

#### ✅ B. **`dask.dataframe` with lazy evaluation and out-of-core computation**

Dask provides a parallel, scalable version of the pandas API. It enables:

* ✅ **Lazy evaluation**: operations are only computed when explicitly requested.
* ✅ **Out-of-core execution**: data is processed in **chunks** that fit in memory.
* ✅ **Parallelism**: leverages multiple cores or even a cluster.

```python
import dask.dataframe as dd

# Load a CSV that is too big for memory
df = dd.read_csv('large_dataset.csv')

# Lazy computation; nothing is executed yet
grouped = df.groupby('category')['value'].mean()

# Compute the result
result = grouped.compute()
```

✔️ Ideal for handling **large-scale tabular data** efficiently without exceeding memory.

### ❌ Other Options:

#### A. **pandas with `low_memory=True` and `chunksize`**

Pandas supports chunked reading using `chunksize`, which is useful for basic iteration. However:

* ❌ It's **not parallelized**
* ❌ You must manage chunk iteration and aggregation logic manually
* ❌ Lacks lazy evaluation and full scalability

```python
import pandas as pd

chunk_iter = pd.read_csv('large_dataset.csv', chunksize=100000, low_memory=True)
for chunk in chunk_iter:
    # Must aggregate manually
    process(chunk)
```

🟡 Useful for small improvements, but **not scalable or elegant**.

---

#### C. **pandas-on-spark (Koalas)**

Pandas-on-Spark bridges pandas APIs with PySpark. It enables distributed processing, but:

* ❌ Requires a full **Spark environment**
* ❌ Overhead is **high** for simple workflows
* ✅ Scalable on big clusters

```python
import pyspark.pandas as ps

psdf = ps.read_csv('large_dataset.csv')
result = psdf.groupby('col')['val'].mean()
```

🟡 Suitable in Spark clusters but **overkill for single-machine out-of-core use**.

---

#### D. **vaex for memory-mapping and out-of-core dataframes**

`vaex` uses memory-mapping and is designed for **fast, memory-efficient analytics**. It's excellent for exploratory data analysis but:

* ❌ API is **less mature** than pandas/Dask
* ❌ Limited functionality for complex transformations
* ✅ Extremely fast for simple stats

```python
import vaex

df = vaex.open('large_dataset.csv')
result = df.groupby('category', agg=vaex.agg.mean('value'))
```

🟡 Great for EDA, but **less flexible and extensible** than Dask.
