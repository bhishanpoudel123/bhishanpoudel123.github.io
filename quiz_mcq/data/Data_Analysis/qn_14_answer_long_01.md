### **Question 14**

**Q:** What's the most rigorous method for selecting the optimal number of components in a Gaussian Mixture Model?

**Options:**

* A. Elbow method with distortion scores
* B. Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) or Akaike Information Criterion (AIC)
* C. Cross-validation with log-likelihood scoring
* D. Variational Bayesian inference with automatic relevance determination

**✅ Correct Answer:** Variational Bayesian inference with automatic relevance determination

### 🧠 Explanation:

#### ✅ D. **Variational Bayesian inference with automatic relevance determination**

This technique uses **Dirichlet Process Gaussian Mixture Models (DP-GMMs)** to **automatically determine the optimal number of components**. It avoids the need to manually compare models with different component counts.

* Uses **Bayesian priors** to shrink unnecessary components.
* Automatically prunes redundant clusters.
* Very useful when the number of clusters is unknown or potentially large.

```python
from sklearn.mixture import BayesianGaussianMixture

model = BayesianGaussianMixture(
    n_components=20,  # upper bound
    weight_concentration_prior_type='dirichlet_process',
    covariance_type='full',
    max_iter=1000,
    random_state=42
)
model.fit(X)  # X is your data
print("Effective components:", sum(model.weights_ > 1e-2))
```

✔️ **Best for rigorous, automatic model complexity control.**

### ❌ Other Options:

#### A. **Elbow method with distortion scores**

The elbow method is common for **KMeans**, but less applicable to **GMMs**. Distortion (inertia) isn’t the best metric for probabilistic models. It also requires manual interpretation of the “elbow,” which is subjective.

```python
from sklearn.mixture import GaussianMixture
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

scores = []
for k in range(1, 15):
    gmm = GaussianMixture(n_components=k).fit(X)
    scores.append(gmm.score(X))

plt.plot(range(1, 15), scores)
plt.xlabel("Components")
plt.ylabel("Log Likelihood")
plt.title("Elbow Method")
plt.show()
```

🔴 **Heuristic and subjective.**

---

#### B. **Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) or Akaike Information Criterion (AIC)**

These are widely used **model selection criteria** based on likelihood penalized by model complexity.

* ✅ AIC is more lenient; BIC penalizes complexity more heavily.
* ❌ Requires **training and evaluating multiple models** with different component counts.
* ❌ Computationally expensive for large datasets.

```python
bics = []
for k in range(1, 15):
    gmm = GaussianMixture(n_components=k).fit(X)
    bics.append(gmm.bic(X))
```

🟡 **Good but inefficient for large-scale automation.**

---

#### C. **Cross-validation with log-likelihood scoring**

Cross-validation estimates generalization ability, but:

* ❌ Not typically used for unsupervised models like GMMs.
* ❌ Difficult to define proper train/test splits due to permutation issues.
* ✅ Can provide stable estimate of log-likelihood.

```python
from sklearn.model_selection import KFold
from sklearn.mixture import GaussianMixture
import numpy as np

kf = KFold(n_splits=5)
scores = []

for k in range(1, 10):
    fold_scores = []
    for train_index, test_index in kf.split(X):
        gmm = GaussianMixture(n_components=k)
        gmm.fit(X[train_index])
        fold_scores.append(gmm.score(X[test_index]))
    scores.append(np.mean(fold_scores))
```

🔴 **Inefficient and less common for clustering tasks.**
