<h1>Data Analysis</h1>
<h2>Qn 01: What technique would you use to handle high-dimensional sparse data when performing PCA?</h2>
<div style="border-radius:10px; padding: 15px; background-color: #ffeacc; font-size:120%; text-align:left">
<strong>Answer:</strong> `Truncated SVD` (also known as LSA)
<br><strong>Explanation:</strong> Truncated SVD is specifically designed for sparse matrices and doesn't center the data (which would destroy sparsity), making it more memory-efficient and appropriate for high-dimensional sparse datasets.
</div>

<h2>Qn 02: What's the most efficient way to perform grouped sampling with replacement in pandas, ensuring each group maintains its original size?</h2>
<div style="border-radius:10px; padding: 15px; background-color: #ffeacc; font-size:120%; text-align:left">
<strong>Answer:</strong> `df.groupby('group').apply(lambda x: x.iloc[np.random.choice(len(x), size=len(x), replace=True)])`
<br><strong>Explanation:</strong> This approach uses numpy's efficient random sampling directly on indices, avoiding the overhead of pandas' sample function while maintaining group sizes and allowing replacement.
</div>

<h2>Qn 03: When implementing stratified k-fold cross-validation for a multi-label classification problem, which approach is most statistically sound?</h2>
<div style="border-radius:10px; padding: 15px; background-color: #ffeacc; font-size:120%; text-align:left">
<strong>Answer:</strong> Use sklearn's `MultilabelStratifiedKFold` from the iterative-stratification package
