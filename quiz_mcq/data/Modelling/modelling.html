<h2>Qn 01: When implementing stacking ensemble with scikit-learn, what's the most rigorous approach to prevent target leakage in the meta-learner?</h2>
<div style="border-radius:10px; padding: 15px; background-color: #ffeacc; font-size:120%; text-align:left">
<strong>Answer:</strong> Manually implement out-of-fold predictions for each base learner
<br><strong>Explanation:</strong> Manually generating out-of-fold predictions ensures the meta-learner only sees predictions made on data that base models weren't trained on, fully preventing leakage while utilizing all data. This approach is more flexible than StackingClassifier and can incorporate diverse base models while maintaining proper validation boundaries.
</div>

<h2>Qn 02: What's the most effective technique for calibrating probability estimates from a gradient boosting classifier?</h2>
<div style="border-radius:10px; padding: 15px; background-color: #ffeacc; font-size:120%; text-align:left">
<strong>Answer:</strong> Apply sklearn's CalibratedClassifierCV with isotonic regression
<br><strong>Explanation:</strong> Isotonic regression via CalibratedClassifierCV is non-parametric and can correct any monotonic distortion in probability estimates, making it more flexible than Platt scaling, particularly for gradient boosting models which often produce well-ranked but not well-calibrated probabilities.
</div>

<h2>Qn 03: Which approach correctly implements proper nested cross-validation for model selection and evaluation?</h2>
<div style="border-radius:10px; padding: 15px; background-color: #ffeacc; font-size:120%; text-align:left">
<strong>Answer:</strong> Nested loops of KFold.split(), with inner loop for hyperparameter tuning
<br><strong>Explanation:</strong> Proper nested cross-validation requires an outer loop for performance estimation and an inner loop for hyperparameter tuning, completely separating the data used for model selection from the data used for model evaluation, avoiding optimistic bias.
</div>

<h2>Qn 04: What's the most memory-efficient way to implement incremental learning for large datasets with scikit-learn?</h2>
<div style="border-radius:10px; padding: 15px; background-color: #ffeacc; font-size:120%; text-align:left">
<strong>Answer:</strong> Use SGDClassifier with partial_fit on data chunks
<br><strong>Explanation:</strong> SGDClassifier with partial_fit allows true incremental learning, processing data in chunks without storing the entire dataset in memory, updating model parameters with each batch and converging to the same solution as batch processing would with sufficient iterations.
</div>

<h2>Qn 05: When dealing with competing risks in survival analysis, which implementation correctly handles the problem?</h2>
<div style="border-radius:10px; padding: 15px; background-color: #ffeacc; font-size:120%; text-align:left">
<strong>Answer:</strong> Fine-Gray subdistribution hazard model from pysurvival
<br><strong>Explanation:</strong> The Fine-Gray model explicitly accounts for competing risks by modeling the subdistribution hazard, allowing for valid inference about the probability of an event in the presence of competing events, unlike standard Cox models or Kaplan-Meier which can produce biased estimates under competing risks.
</div>

<h2>Qn 06: What's the most statistically sound approach to implement monotonic constraints in gradient boosting?</h2>
<div style="border-radius:10px; padding: 15px; background-color: #ffeacc; font-size:120%; text-align:left">
<strong>Answer:</strong> Using XGBoost's monotone_constraints parameter
<br><strong>Explanation:</strong> XGBoost's native monotone_constraints parameter enforces monotonicity during tree building by constraining only monotonic splits, resulting in a fully monotonic model without sacrificing performanceâ€”unlike post-processing which can degrade model accuracy or pre-processing which doesn't guarantee model monotonicity.
</div>

<h2>Qn 07: Which approach correctly implements a custom kernel for SVM in scikit-learn?</h2>
<div style="border-radius:10px; padding: 15px; background-color: #ffeacc; font-size:120%; text-align:left">
<strong>Answer:</strong> Define a function that takes two arrays and returns a kernel matrix
<br><strong>Explanation:</strong> For custom kernels in scikit-learn SVMs, one must define a function K(X, Y) that calculates the kernel matrix between arrays X and Y, then pass this function as the 'kernel' parameter to SVC. This approach allows full flexibility in kernel design while maintaining compatibility with scikit-learn's implementation.
</div>

<h2>Qn 08: What's the most rigorous approach to handle feature selection with highly correlated features in a regression context?</h2>
<div style="border-radius:10px; padding: 15px; background-color: #ffeacc; font-size:120%; text-align:left">
<strong>Answer:</strong> Elastic Net regularization with randomized hyperparameter search
<br><strong>Explanation:</strong> Elastic Net combines L1 and L2 penalties, effectively handling correlated features by either selecting one from a correlated group (via L1) or assigning similar coefficients to correlated features (via L2), with the optimal balance determined through randomized hyperparameter search across different alpha and l1_ratio values.
</div>

<h2>Qn 09: Which implementation correctly handles ordinal encoding for machine learning while preserving the ordinal nature of features?</h2>
<div style="border-radius:10px; padding: 15px; background-color: #ffeacc; font-size:120%; text-align:left">
<strong>Answer:</strong> Custom encoding using pd.Categorical with ordered=True
<br><strong>Explanation:</strong> Using pandas Categorical with ordered=True preserves the ordinal relationship and allows for appropriate distance calculations between categories, which is essential for models that consider feature relationships (unlike OrdinalEncoder which assigns arbitrary numeric values without preserving distances).
</div>

<h2>Qn 10: What's the most effective way to implement a time-based split for cross-validation in time series forecasting?</h2>
<div style="border-radius:10px; padding: 15px; background-color: #ffeacc; font-size:120%; text-align:left">
<strong>Answer:</strong> Define a custom cross-validator with expanding window and purging
<br><strong>Explanation:</strong> A custom cross-validator with expanding windows (increasing training set) and purging (gap between train and test to prevent leakage) most accurately simulates real-world forecasting scenarios while handling temporal dependencies and avoiding lookahead bias.
</div>

<h2>Qn 11: Which approach correctly implements an interpretable model for binary classification with uncertainty quantification?</h2>
<div style="border-radius:10px; padding: 15px; background-color: #ffeacc; font-size:120%; text-align:left">
<strong>Answer:</strong> Bayesian Logistic Regression with MCMC sampling for posterior distribution
<br><strong>Explanation:</strong> Bayesian Logistic Regression provides both interpretability (coefficients have clear meanings) and principled uncertainty quantification through the posterior distribution of parameters, capturing both aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty while maintaining model transparency.
</div>

<h2>Qn 12: What's the most robust approach to handling class imbalance in a multi-class classification problem?</h2>
<div style="border-radius:10px; padding: 15px; background-color: #ffeacc; font-size:120%; text-align:left">
<strong>Answer:</strong> Use ensemble methods with resampling strategies specific to each classifier
<br><strong>Explanation:</strong> Ensemble methods with class-specific resampling strategies (e.g., EasyEnsemble or SMOTEBoost) combine the diversity of multiple classifiers with targeted handling of class imbalance, outperforming both global resampling and simple class weighting, especially for multi-class problems with varying degrees of imbalance.
</div>

<h2>Qn 13: Which technique is most appropriate for detecting and quantifying the importance of interaction effects in a Random Forest model?</h2>
<div style="border-radius:10px; padding: 15px; background-color: #ffeacc; font-size:120%; text-align:left">
<strong>Answer:</strong> Implement H-statistic from Friedman and Popescu
<br><strong>Explanation:</strong> The H-statistic specifically quantifies interaction strength between features by comparing the variation in predictions when features are varied together versus independently, providing a statistical measure of interactions that can't be captured by standard importance metrics or partial dependence alone.
</div>

<h2>Qn 14: What's the correct approach to implement a custom scoring function for sklearn's RandomizedSearchCV that accounts for both predictive performance and model complexity?</h2>
<div style="border-radius:10px; padding: 15px; background-color: #ffeacc; font-size:120%; text-align:left">
<strong>Answer:</strong> Use make_scorer with a function that combines multiple metrics
<br><strong>Explanation:</strong> make_scorer allows creating a custom scoring function that can combine predictive performance (e.g., AUC) with penalties for model complexity (e.g., number of features or model parameters), providing a single metric for optimization that balances performance and parsimony.
</div>

<h2>Qn 15: Which is the most statistically rigorous approach to implement feature selection for a regression problem with heteroscedastic errors?</h2>
<div style="border-radius:10px; padding: 15px; background-color: #ffeacc; font-size:120%; text-align:left">
<strong>Answer:</strong> Implement weighted LASSO with weight inversely proportional to error variance
<br><strong>Explanation:</strong> Weighted LASSO that downweights observations with high error variance accounts for heteroscedasticity in the selection process, ensuring that features aren't selected or rejected due to non-constant error variance, resulting in more reliable feature selection.
</div>

<h2>Qn 16: What's the most effective way to implement an interpretable yet powerful model for regression with potentially non-linear effects?</h2>
<div style="border-radius:10px; padding: 15px; background-color: #ffeacc; font-size:120%; text-align:left">
<strong>Answer:</strong> Use Explainable Boosting Machines (EBMs) from InterpretML
<br><strong>Explanation:</strong> EBMs combine the interpretability of GAMs with the predictive power of boosting, learning feature functions and pairwise interactions in an additive structure while remaining highly interpretable, offering better performance than standard GAMs while maintaining transparency.
</div>

<h2>Qn 17: Which approach correctly implements quantile regression forests for prediction intervals?</h2>
<div style="border-radius:10px; padding: 15px; background-color: #ffeacc; font-size:120%; text-align:left">
<strong>Answer:</strong> Implement a custom version of RandomForestRegressor that stores all leaf node samples
<br><strong>Explanation:</strong> Quantile regression forests require storing the empirical distribution of training samples in each leaf node (not just their mean), requiring a custom implementation that extends standard random forests to compute conditional quantiles from these stored distributions.
</div>

<h2>Qn 18: What's the most rigorous approach to handle outliers in the target variable for regression problems?</h2>
<div style="border-radius:10px; padding: 15px; background-color: #ffeacc; font-size:120%; text-align:left">
<strong>Answer:</strong> Use Huber or Quantile regression with robust loss functions
<br><strong>Explanation:</strong> Robust regression methods like Huber or Quantile regression use loss functions that inherently reduce the influence of outliers during model training, addressing the issue without removing potentially valuable data points or distorting the target distribution through transformations.
</div>

<h2>Qn 19: Which implementation correctly addresses the curse of dimensionality in nearest neighbor models?</h2>
<div style="border-radius:10px; padding: 15px; background-color: #ffeacc; font-size:120%; text-align:left">
<strong>Answer:</strong> Implement distance metric learning with NCA or LMNN
<br><strong>Explanation:</strong> Distance metric learning adaptively learns a transformation of the feature space that emphasizes discriminative dimensions, effectively addressing the curse of dimensionality by creating a more semantically meaningful distance metric, unlike fixed trees or general dimensionality reduction.
</div>

<h2>Qn 20: What's the most efficient way to implement early stopping in a gradient boosting model to prevent overfitting?</h2>
<div style="border-radius:10px; padding: 15px; background-color: #ffeacc; font-size:120%; text-align:left">
<strong>Answer:</strong> Use early_stopping_rounds with a validation set in XGBoost/LightGBM
<br><strong>Explanation:</strong> Using early_stopping_rounds with a separate validation set stops training when performance on the validation set stops improving for a specified number of rounds, efficiently determining the optimal number of trees in a single training run without requiring multiple cross-validation runs.
</div>

<h2>Qn 21: Which approach correctly implements a counterfactual explanation method for a black-box classifier?</h2>
<div style="border-radius:10px; padding: 15px; background-color: #ffeacc; font-size:120%; text-align:left">
<strong>Answer:</strong> Implement DiCE (Diverse Counterfactual Explanations) to generate multiple feasible counterfactuals
<br><strong>Explanation:</strong> DiCE specifically generates diverse counterfactual explanations that show how an instance's features would need to change to receive a different classification, addressing the 'what-if' question directly rather than just explaining the current prediction.
</div>

<h2>Qn 22: What's the most effective approach to implement online learning for a regression task with concept drift?</h2>
<div style="border-radius:10px; padding: 15px; background-color: #ffeacc; font-size:120%; text-align:left">
<strong>Answer:</strong> Use incremental learning with drift detection algorithms to trigger model updates
<br><strong>Explanation:</strong> Combining incremental learning with explicit drift detection (e.g., ADWIN, DDM) allows the model to adapt continuously to new data while only performing major updates when the data distribution actually changes, balancing computational efficiency with adaptation to concept drift.
</div>

<h2>Qn 23: Which method is most appropriate for tuning hyperparameters when training time is extremely limited?</h2>
<div style="border-radius:10px; padding: 15px; background-color: #ffeacc; font-size:120%; text-align:left">
<strong>Answer:</strong> Implement multi-fidelity optimization with Hyperband

</div>

<h2>Qn 24: What's the most statistically sound approach to implement feature selection for time series forecasting?</h2>
<div style="border-radius:10px; padding: 15px; background-color: #ffeacc; font-size:120%; text-align:left">
<strong>Answer:</strong> Implement feature importance from tree-based models with purged cross-validation
<br><strong>Explanation:</strong> Tree-based feature importance combined with purged cross-validation (which leaves gaps between train and test sets) correctly handles temporal dependence in the data, preventing information leakage while identifying features that have genuine predictive power for future time points.
</div>

<h2>Qn 25: Which approach correctly addresses Simpson's paradox in a predictive modeling context?</h2>
<div style="border-radius:10px; padding: 15px; background-color: #ffeacc; font-size:120%; text-align:left">
<strong>Answer:</strong> Use causal graphical models to identify proper conditioning sets
<br><strong>Explanation:</strong> Causal graphical models (e.g., DAGs) allow identifying which variables should or should not be conditioned on to avoid Simpson's paradox, ensuring that the model captures the true causal relationship rather than spurious associations that reverse with conditioning.
</div>

<h2>Qn 26: What's the most efficient way to implement hyperparameter tuning for an ensemble of diverse model types?</h2>
<div style="border-radius:10px; padding: 15px; background-color: #ffeacc; font-size:120%; text-align:left">
<strong>Answer:</strong> Apply multi-objective Bayesian optimization to balance diversity and performance
<br><strong>Explanation:</strong> Multi-objective Bayesian optimization can simultaneously optimize for both individual model performance and ensemble diversity, finding an optimal set of hyperparameters for each model type while ensuring the ensemble as a whole performs well through complementary strengths.
</div>

<h2>Qn 27: Which technique is most appropriate for detecting and visualizing non-linear relationships in supervised learning?</h2>
<div style="border-radius:10px; padding: 15px; background-color: #ffeacc; font-size:120%; text-align:left">
<strong>Answer:</strong> Individual Conditional Expectation (ICE) plots with centered PDP
<br><strong>Explanation:</strong> ICE plots show how predictions change for individual instances across the range of a feature, while centering them helps visualize heterogeneous effects that would be masked by averaging in standard partial dependence plots, making them ideal for detecting complex non-linear relationships.
</div>

<h2>Qn 28: What's the most rigorous approach to quantify uncertainty in predictions from a gradient boosting model?</h2>
<div style="border-radius:10px; padding: 15px; background-color: #ffeacc; font-size:120%; text-align:left">
<strong>Answer:</strong> Use quantile regression with multiple target quantiles
<br><strong>Explanation:</strong> Training multiple gradient boosting models with quantile loss functions at different quantiles (e.g., 5%, 50%, 95%) directly models the conditional distribution of the target variable, providing a rigorous non-parametric approach to uncertainty quantification that captures heteroscedasticity.
</div>

<h2>Qn 29: What's the most appropriate technique for automated feature engineering in time series forecasting?</h2>
<div style="border-radius:10px; padding: 15px; background-color: #ffeacc; font-size:120%; text-align:left">
