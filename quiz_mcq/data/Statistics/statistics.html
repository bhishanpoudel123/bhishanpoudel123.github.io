<h2>Qn 01: What does the p-value represent in hypothesis testing?</h2>
<div style="border-radius:10px; padding: 15px; background-color: #ffeacc; font-size:120%; text-align:left">
<strong>Answer:</strong> Probability of obtaining test results at least as extreme as the results actually observed
<br><strong>Explanation:</strong> The p-value quantifies the evidence against the null hypothesis. A small p-value suggests the observed data is unlikely under the null hypothesis.
</div>

<h2>Qn 02: What is the main difference between population and sample in statistics?</h2>
<div style="border-radius:10px; padding: 15px; background-color: #ffeacc; font-size:120%; text-align:left">
<strong>Answer:</strong> Sample is a subset of population
<br><strong>Explanation:</strong> A population includes all elements from a set of data, while a sample consists of one or more observations drawn from the population.

<h2>Qn 03: What does standard deviation measure?</h2>
<div style="border-radius:10px; padding: 15px; background-color: #ffeacc; font-size:120%; text-align:left">
<strong>Answer:</strong> Spread of data
<br><strong>Explanation:</strong> Standard deviation measures the amount of variation or dispersion of a set of values.
</div>

<h2>Qn 04: In a normal distribution, what percentage of data lies within one standard deviation of the mean?</h2>
<div style="border-radius:10px; padding: 15px; background-color: #ffeacc; font-size:120%; text-align:left">
<strong>Answer:</strong> 68%
<br><strong>Explanation:</strong> In a normal distribution, approximately 68% of the data falls within one standard deviation of the mean.
</div>

<h2>Qn 05: Which of the following measures of central tendency is not affected by extreme values?</h2>
<div style="border-radius:10px; padding: 15px; background-color: #ffeacc; font-size:120%; text-align:left">
<strong>Answer:</strong> Median
<br><strong>Explanation:</strong> Median is the middle value and is not affected by extremely large or small values, unlike the mean.
