    "options": [
      "Probability of null hypothesis being true",
      "Probability of obtaining test results at least as extreme as the results actually observed",
      "Probability of alternative hypothesis",
      "Confidence level"
    ],
    "answer": "Probability of obtaining test results at least as extreme as the results actually observed",
    "explanation": "The p-value quantifies the evidence against the null hypothesis. A small p-value suggests the observed data is unlikely under the null hypothesis."

      "Sample is larger than population",

    "answer": "Sample is a subset of population",
    "explanation": "A population includes all elements from a set of data, while a sample consists of one or more observations drawn from the population."
