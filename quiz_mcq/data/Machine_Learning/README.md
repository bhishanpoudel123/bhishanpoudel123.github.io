### <a id="q02"></a> Qn 02

**Question**  
What is the purpose of the learning rate in gradient descent?

**Options**  
1. To control the number of iterations  
2. To avoid overfitting  
3. To control how much the model is adjusted during each update  
4. To validate the model  

**Answer**  
To control how much the model is adjusted during each update

**Explanation**  
The learning rate determines the step size at each iteration while moving toward
  a minimum of a loss function.

### <a id="q03"></a> Qn 03

**Question**  
Which technique is used to reduce the dimensionality of data?

**Options**  
1. Gradient Descent  
2. Regularization  
3. PCA  
4. Bagging  

**Answer**  
PCA

**Explanation**  
Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a dimensionality reduction technique that
  transforms data to a lower-dimensional space.

### <a id="q04"></a> Qn 04

**Question**  
What is the main goal of unsupervised learning?

**Options**  
1. Predict outcomes based on labeled data  
2. Optimize a function  
3. Find hidden patterns or groupings in data  
4. Validate model accuracy  

**Answer**  
Find hidden patterns or groupings in data

**Explanation**  
Unsupervised learning aims to discover the underlying structure of data without
  predefined labels.

### <a id="q05"></a> Qn 05

**Question**  
What is overfitting in machine learning?

**Options**  
1. When the model performs well on test data but poorly on training data  
2. When the model performs well on training data but poorly on test data  
3. When the model performs well on both training and test data  
4. When the model ignores outliers in the data  

**Answer**  
When the model performs well on training data but poorly on test data

**Explanation**  
Overfitting occurs when a model learns the training data too well, including
  noise and outliers, which leads to poor generalization to new data.
