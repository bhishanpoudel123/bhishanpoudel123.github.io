<h1>Machine Learning</h1>
<h2>Qn 01: Which algorithm is used for classification problems?</h2>
<div style="border-radius:10px; padding: 15px; background-color: #ffeacc; font-size:120%; text-align:left">
<strong>Answer:</strong> Logistic Regression
<br><strong>Explanation:</strong> Logistic regression is used for binary and multi-class classification problems.

<h2>Qn 02: What is the purpose of the learning rate in gradient descent?</h2>
<div style="border-radius:10px; padding: 15px; background-color: #ffeacc; font-size:120%; text-align:left">
<strong>Answer:</strong> To control how much the model is adjusted during each update
<br><strong>Explanation:</strong> The learning rate determines the step size at each iteration while moving toward a minimum of a loss function.
</div>

<h2>Qn 03: Which technique is used to reduce the dimensionality of data?</h2>
<div style="border-radius:10px; padding: 15px; background-color: #ffeacc; font-size:120%; text-align:left">
<strong>Answer:</strong> PCA
<br><strong>Explanation:</strong> Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a dimensionality reduction technique that transforms data to a lower-dimensional space.

<h2>Qn 04: What is the main goal of unsupervised learning?</h2>
<div style="border-radius:10px; padding: 15px; background-color: #ffeacc; font-size:120%; text-align:left">
<strong>Answer:</strong> Find hidden patterns or groupings in data
<br><strong>Explanation:</strong> Unsupervised learning aims to discover the underlying structure of data without predefined labels.
</div>

<h2>Qn 05: What is overfitting in machine learning?</h2>
<div style="border-radius:10px; padding: 15px; background-color: #ffeacc; font-size:120%; text-align:left">
<strong>Answer:</strong> When the model performs well on training data but poorly on test data
<br><strong>Explanation:</strong> Overfitting occurs when a model learns the training data too well, including noise and outliers, which leads to poor generalization to new data.
