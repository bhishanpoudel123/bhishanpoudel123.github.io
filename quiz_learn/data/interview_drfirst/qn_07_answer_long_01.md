**Q: How comfortable are you using SQL?**

**Answer:**

I’m very comfortable using SQL and have used it extensively in both analytical and production environments.

At Cencora and AmerisourceBergen, I regularly used SQL for data extraction, transformation, and validation from large-scale cloud databases like **Snowflake** and **Azure Databricks**. I wrote complex queries involving **CTEs**, **window functions**, **joins across multiple tables**, and **nested subqueries** to prepare features for machine learning models and generate ad hoc business reports.

For example, in a recent A/B testing project, I wrote SQL scripts to extract experiment data, segment users by behavior, and compute statistical aggregates like conversion rates, confidence intervals, and lift — all directly in SQL before bringing the data into Python for deeper statistical analysis.

I also collaborated with data engineers to optimize long-running queries using **indexing strategies**, **partitioning**, and **query plan analysis**, which improved performance significantly on large datasets.

So whether it's writing ETL pipelines, crafting data models, or supporting machine learning workflows, SQL is a core tool in my daily data science work.
