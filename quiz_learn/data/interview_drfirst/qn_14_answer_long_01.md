# Q: What are the projects you are interested in?

## Interview Question: What types of projects are you most interested in working on at DrFirst?

**Answer:** Based on my experience and the job description, I'm particularly excited about three types of projects at DrFirst that align perfectly with my background:

1. **AI-Powered Form Processing System**  
   *"I've successfully developed an in-house AI chatbot at Cencora that automated patient service queries by retrieving data and generating insights. This directly parallels DrFirst's need to process complex healthcare forms. I implemented PII data masking and robust authentication mechanisms while working with LLMs (OpenAI, LangChain), which would be valuable for ensuring HIPAA compliance in your form processing solution."*

2. **Clinical Text Analytics & NLP Solutions**  
   *"At AmerisourceBergen, I implemented NLP-based clinical note classification using LLMs and GPT-based models to segment patient chatter. My work with BERT, T5 transformers, and handling healthcare acronyms/slang would directly apply to DrFirst's initiatives in ambient listening and medical record analysis. I particularly enjoy the challenge of making NLP models robust enough for clinical environments."*

3. **Agentic Automation & MLOps Infrastructure**  
   *"Having deployed end-to-end Azure web services with CI/CD pipelines, I'm eager to contribute to DrFirst's agentic automation projects. My experience with Azure DevOps, FastAPI deployment, and building ethical AI frameworks would help scale your solutions while maintaining compliance. The fraud detection system I built (with XGBoost and custom evaluation metrics) demonstrates my ability to create production-grade ML systems."*

**What excites me most** is that DrFirst combines all three areas I'm passionate about: cutting-edge NLP, healthcare impact, and scalable MLOps implementation. Having worked on timeseries forecasting for drug sales and competitor analysis, I'm particularly interested in how these skills could enhance your virtual medical assistant and data quality uplift initiatives.
