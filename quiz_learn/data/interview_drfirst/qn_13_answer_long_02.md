**Interviewer**: Why do we multiply by IDF in the TF-IDF calculation? What's the purpose?

**Me**: That's an excellent question about the fundamental logic behind TF-IDF.

We multiply by IDF (Inverse Document Frequency) for several critical reasons:

**1. Reducing common word impact:**
- Common words like "the," "and," "is" appear in almost every document
- Without IDF, these high-frequency but low-information words would dominate our analysis
- IDF systematically reduces the weight of terms that occur in many documents

**2. Emphasizing discriminative terms:**
- Words that appear in fewer documents are often more informative for distinguishing between documents
- IDF amplifies the importance of rare, specialized terms
- For example, in healthcare data, terms like "metastasis" or "tachycardia" appear less frequently but carry significant meaning

**3. Mathematical formulation:**
- IDF = log(N/df_t) where:
  - N = total number of documents
  - df_t = number of documents containing term t
- As a term appears in more documents, its IDF value approaches zero
- As a term appears in fewer documents, its IDF value increases

**4. Practical example:**
- Consider two terms in a medical corpus:
  - "Patient" (appears in 90% of documents) would have a low IDF
  - "Hyperthyroidism" (appears in 2% of documents) would have a high IDF
- When multiplied by respective term frequencies, "hyperthyroidism" gains greater weight despite potentially lower frequency within individual documents

In my work classifying patient communications at Cencora, this property was invaluable for identifying specific medical concerns or requests amid more general healthcare language. The IDF component ensured that distinctive terminology received appropriate emphasis in our classification models.
