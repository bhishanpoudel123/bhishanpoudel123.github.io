# Interview Question: What are the different approaches to parallel computing in Python, and how have you used them in your projects?

**Answer:** In my work with large healthcare datasets and ML models, I've implemented several parallel computing paradigms in Python. Here's a technical breakdown of the main approaches:

### 1. **Multiprocessing (CPU-bound tasks)**
```python
from multiprocessing import Pool
import pandas as pd

def process_chunk(chunk):
    # Example: Feature engineering on DataFrame chunks
    return chunk.apply(lambda x: x**2)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    data = pd.read_csv('large_medical_dataset.csv', chunksize=10000)
    with Pool(processes=4) as pool:  # Uses all CPU cores
        results = pool.map(process_chunk, data)
    final_df = pd.concat(results)
```
*Used in my timeseries forecasting project to parallelize ARIMA model fitting across different drug categories.*

### 2. **Threading (I/O-bound tasks)**
```python
from concurrent.futures import ThreadPoolExecutor
import requests

def fetch_patient_data(patient_id):
    response = requests.get(f'https://api/patient/{patient_id}')
    return response.json()

with ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=10) as executor:
    results = list(executor.map(fetch_patient_data, patient_ids))
```
*Applied in my healthcare competitor analysis to parallelize API calls to different data sources.*

### 3. **Joblib (ML pipelines)**
```python
from joblib import Parallel, delayed
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier

def train_model(X_train, y_train, params):
    return RandomForestClassifier(**params).fit(X_train, y_train)

models = Parallel(n_jobs=-1)(
    delayed(train_model)(X_train, y_train, params) 
    for params in param_grid
)
```
*Utilized in my fraud detection project for hyperparameter tuning across 50+ combinations.*

### 4. **Dask (Out-of-core computations)**
```python
import dask.dataframe as dd

ddf = dd.read_csv('s3://bucket/patient_*.csv')  # 50GB+ dataset
result = (ddf.groupby('diagnosis_code')
          .agg({'medication_cost': ['mean', 'std']})
          .compute(num_workers=8))
```
*Implemented in my PowerBI dashboard project to process 60M+ pharmacy claims records.*

### 5. **Ray (Distributed computing)**
```python
import ray
ray.init()

@ray.remote
class LLMValidator:
    def __init__(self):
        self.model = load_llm()

    def validate(self, text):
        return self.model.check_consistency(text)

validators = [LLMValidator.remote() for _ in range(8)]
results = ray.get([v.validate.remote(note) for v in validators])
```
*Deployed in my clinical text analytics system to parallelize LLM inference across GPU nodes.*

### 6. **CUDA/PyTorch (GPU acceleration)**
```python
import torch

device = torch.device('cuda:0' if torch.cuda.is_available() else 'cpu')
model = BioClinicalBERT().to(device)
inputs = batch.to(device)  # Moves data to GPU
outputs = model(inputs)    # Parallelized across GPU cores
```

**Key Considerations in Healthcare Applications:**
- For PHI data: Ensure secure inter-process communication (avoid shared memory)
- On Azure/AWS: Use `ray cluster` for cloud-scale distributed computing
- For Spark integration: `pyspark.pandas` or `Koalas` for DataFrame operations
- Monitoring: Always track memory usage (`memory_profiler`) to prevent OOM crashes

*Would you like me to elaborate on how I handled parallel processing for HIPAA-compliant data pipelines specifically?*
