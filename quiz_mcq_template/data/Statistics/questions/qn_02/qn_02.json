    "question": "What technique would you use to handle high-dimensional sparse data when performing PCA?",
    "options": [
        "Standard PCA with normalization",
        "`Truncated SVD` (also known as LSA)",
        "`Kernel PCA` with RBF kernel",
        "`Factor Analysis`"
    ],
    "answer": "`Truncated SVD` (also known as LSA)",
    "explanation": "Truncated SVD is specifically designed for sparse matrices and doesn't center the data (which would destroy sparsity), making it more memory-efficient and appropriate for high-dimensional sparse datasets.",
